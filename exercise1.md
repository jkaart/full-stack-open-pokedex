# Python

## Common CI steps

Python CI pipeline you can integrate linting, testing and building steps.

## Tools

You can use Pylint, flake8, mypy and Ruff tools to lint a Python app. For Python app testing you can use tools like python's built-in unittest framework and pytest. For building you can use pip or build building frontend tools. Build frontend use build backends such as flit-core, hatchling, maturin, meson-python, scikit-build-core and setuptools.

## CI alternatives

Most popular CI alternatives for Jenkins and GitHub Actions are AzureDevOps, GitLab CI, CircleCI and Bitrise CI/CD.

## Self-hosted or cloud-based environment

Since it is not a large project (only 6 people in the team) and do not have given any special requirements, we can use a cloud-based environment. This can also be cheaper than self-hosted setup because it do not need setup and maintenance own server hardware and software.
